# Ticket #0001 - Horiseo Pty Ltd

## Refactoring existing code for search engine optimisation
 ```
A marketing agency has created a ticket and would like their existing code refactored so that it follows accessibility standards with the outcome optimisised for serach engines
```

### Upon first look

```
* Upon looking at the index.html I firstly saw the images had no alt codes.

* Checked the links and found one was not functioning.

* Can see a number of elements following the same rules.

* No visability on the navigation menu when hovering over buttons
```

### What I did

```
1. Added alt codes to each image in the index.html file

2. Fixed the href for Search Engine Optimization to follow the ID so when clicking on this on the webpage it directs you to relevant content 

3. Consolidated h1,h2,h3 and removed additional css code in the style.css file

4. Rearranged the CSS into sequential order to follow semantic HTML elements
